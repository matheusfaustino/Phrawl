## Phrawl: A web crawling framework in PHP (or it seems so)

Phrawl is a lib aiming to be a web crawling framework for PHP. It was created with the idea of joining all the good libs around PHP in one place to help those who want to crawl the internet. It's inspired by Scrapy.

It is a WIP lib, so it lacks some features like integration with a webdriver (as Selenium) and an async I/O. 

I will add some examples soon...
